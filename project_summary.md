## Description
The DevArt wall is a concept that looks to combine and promote code and modern technology, while embracing technology's past and present. Art means different things to different people. In an effort to promote code and people's own view of art in an interactive environment, we have come up with the idea of DevArt Wall, which allows people to contribute their own artistic values to an ever changing art peice.  

DevArt Wall features a wall of technology, covered in past and present devices, all linked together using code. Our app allows users to submit their own opinion of art, which has to be submited through the app after the user learns to write their message in their own string of code or by submitting their own artpiece or image. Visitors messages and images will then be shown on the DevArt wall across the various featured devices.
